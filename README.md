Idea:

The idea was to build a demo of a online classifieds website. 
Yes, it's true, there are many websites offering this service, but I wanted to build my own, or, at least, a demo of it. 
I just wanted to build something easy to use, a website where you can upload your products and let the people see them and contact you. 
Once again, this is a demo version, so you can only sign-up / log-in using the google button and you can't really delete or edit your post, but you can see your own posts in a private section and see each others posts in the public posts section, I hope I can finish it in the future, cause I really enjoyed coding it.
